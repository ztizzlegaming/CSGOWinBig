					<h4>About CSGO Win Big</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
					CSGO Win Big is a new Counter-Strike: Global Offensive jackpot-style betting website that is fully open source. You can view the source code for the website <a href="https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig" target="_blank">here</a>, and view the source code for the Steam Bot that handles deposits and payouts <a href="https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig-SteamBot" target="_blank">here</a>. This website was created by, developed, and is run by Jordan Turley. If you have any questions about this website, email me at <a href="mailto:support@csgowinbig.com">support@csgowinbig.com</a>. And of course, good luck!

					<hr>

					Item prices:
					<br>
					Item prices are gotten from our database, which you can view <a href="prices.html">here</a>. If you find that a price for an item is incorrect, then you can submit a 'Price Change Ticket' there, and we will look into it. If for some reason an item cannot be found in our database, you can submit a 'New Item Ticket', and we will add the item as soon as possible. Until we add the item, the Steam community market will be used for pricing of these items.

					<hr>

					What sets us apart from other betting websites:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Low minimum bet
							<ul>
								<li>
									The minimum bet is only $0.20, in comparison to $2 and $3 from similar sites; low enough that anyone can participate, but high enough that the pot doesn't fill up with 4 cent skins.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Only 2% cut taken by website
							<ul>
								<li>
									This site will only take about a 2% cut, and will never take more than 5%. Similar sites take as much as 5% and no more than 10%.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Open Source
							<ul>
								<li>
									CSGO Win Big is fully open source. All of the code for both <a href="https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig" target="_link">the website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig-SteamBot" target="_blank">the Steam bot</a> can be viewed on Github.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Not a Scam
							<ul>
								<li>
									These days, there are so many people trying to scam you. However, that is not me. This site is 100% legitimate; the source code for the website and the bot is public, and can be viewed by anyone.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<hr>

					The way it works is simple:
					<ol>
						<li>Deposit your skins by clicking the button in the top right</li>
						<li>Your tickets will be calculated. For example, if you deposit $1 of skins, you get 100 tickets; $10 gets you 1000 tickets. 1 cent is 1 ticket.</li>
						<li>When the pot reaches 60 skins, a winner will be randomly chosen, and ~98% of the skins will be send to you in a trade offer (Learn more about this in 'Rules and other information' below).</li>
					</ol>

					<hr>

					"Why was my trade offer declined?" Your trade offer may have been declined because:
					<ul>
						<li>Your inventory is set to private.</li>
						<li>Your offer didn't meet the minimum bet of $0.20.</li>
						<li>Your offer was not a gift (you tried to get items from the bot instead of just giving).</li>
						<li>Your offer contained more than the 10 item limit.</li>
						<li>One or more of the items in your offer was not for CS: GO.</li>
					</ul>

					<hr>

					Rules and other information:
					<ul>
						<li>The pot can be a bit larger than 60 skins, depending on how many skins are in the last deposit.</li>
						<li>The site will keep about 2% of the skins in every pot, but no more than 5%. The amount taken will be as close to 2% as it can be, depending on the items in the pot, but will never be more than 5%. This is so that the staff of CSGO Win Big can keep the site running as best as it can, without having any annoying ads on the site.</li>
						<li>If you experience any lost items, such as depositing an item but not seeing it in the pot, or winning a pot but not receiving a trade offer, please submit a <a href="support.html">support ticket</a> and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</li>
					</ul>

# CSGO Win Big

### What is this?
CSGO Win Big is a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive jackpot skin betting website, created by me, Jordan Turley. It is hosted through Bluehost at http://www.csgowinbig.com

### How does CSGO Win Big work?
This is the repository for the website for CSGO Win Big. It is written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the client-side, and PHP for the server-side.  
We are also making use of the following libraries/frameworks:
* jQuery - http://jquery.com/
* Bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/
* Underscore.js - http://underscorejs.org/
* SweetAlert - http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/
* SteamAuthentication - https://github.com/SmItH197/SteamAuthentication

In addition to the website, we are also making use of a custom version of [Jessecar96's Steam Bot](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot), which can be found [here](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/SteamBot), and is written in C#.

### How to setup this project for my own use?
If you would like to setup this project for your own project, there are a couple of steps you must follow:

* In src/php/default.php, you must configure your own database credentials. The way I have it setup is I have a file outside of the web root with my passwords in it, called 'passwords.txt', which I read and get the password for the database from, instead of writing my password directly in the code. Then, import database-config.sql to your MySQL database.  If you want to use a database other than MySQL, you will have to set it up on your own.
* Also, because you login through Steam for this site, you must have a Steam API Key. You can request a key for yourself [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Like the database password, I also have this key stored outside of the web root in passwords.txt.
* You will also have to put in your own website url and database stuff in some places, instead of mine. These places are:
  * [Lines 5, 6, and 7 of default.php](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/php/default.php#L5)
  * [Line 14 of settings.php](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/php/SteamAuthentication/steamauth/settings.php#L14)
  * [Line 30 of support-ticket.php](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/php/support-ticket.php#L30)
  * [Line 6 of bot-withdraw.php](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/php/bot-withdraw.php#L6). For this, you will need to enter the 64bit ID of your Steam bot. You can find this in the bot's profile url, or on websites such as http://steamrep.com.
  * [Lines 44](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/index.html#L44) and [92](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/index.html#L92) of index.html, [line 96 of support.html](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/support.html#L96), [line 82 of donations.html](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/donations.html#L82), and [line 148 of prices.html](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/prices.html#L148). Here, you must modify the sign in url to have your own website's url. You must change where it says 'openid.return_to=' and 'openid.realm=' to be your own website's url.
  * [Line 149 of script.js](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/script.js#L149). Here, you must put in the trade url of your own bot.
  * [Line 252 of script.js](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig/blob/master/src/script.js#L252). Replace " CSGO Win Big" with your website title ;

* One last thing, the site assumes that there will always be chat messages, so you have to manually insert one chat message into the chat database table.
* Here is an example of my passwords.txt:  
{"default-password":"YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD","steamAPIKey":"YOUR STEAM API KEY"}

### Troubleshooting
* If you are trying to get this website set up and encounter any errors, please add [TheAnthonyNL](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001581508/) on Steam, and leave a comment on his profile, saying that you need help setting up this project. DO NOT submit an issue, only submit an issue if there is something legitimately wrong with the code. Also, please try something on your own before messaging.
* Please DO NOT add me on Steam, add Anthony. I apologize, but I am too busy as it is with school and my own site to help troubleshoot other peoples' sites.
* One very common error people have been getting is their site being stuck at "loading...". If this is the case, go to the /php/login-status.php file on your server, and see what it says. If it says "file not found", this means that the passwords.txt file cannot be found on your server. You may have it in the wrong location; it is supossed to be located outside of the web root, one level up from the public_html folder on your server. It is possible, however, that your hosting doesn't allow access outside of the web root, so if this is the case, you will just have to hard code in your API Key and password. To hard code in your password, follow these steps: http://pastebin.com/8ZCNq7f8
